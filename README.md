# Tides
Shows tides, sun/moon, &amp; weather for a zip code from Weather .gov api

Weather Underground eliminated their free plan so I moved this to use a database for tides and sun moon data then weather.gov api for forecast.

Enter the zip code as part of the URL,e.g., tides.php?zip-34236, to display for a certain zip code.
