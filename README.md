# Tides
Shows tides, sun/moon, &amp; weather for a zip code from Weather Underground api

You will need to get your own key from Weather Underground. I use a free key and my PAICache class to save the result for 12 hours so the use of the key is free even with many users.

Enter the zip code as part of the URL,e.g., tides.php?zip-34236, to display for a certain zip code.
